# Defining domain objects in laravel

# Create the database migration for the tables
# Note that this does not create any Models/Domain classes
php artisan migrate:make create_tables
# This should create a file in the migrations folder
# In the file update up/down methods to describe the tables you want to create
#
# Once you have defined them run
# Stage the changes
php artisan migrate --pretend
# Run them. This actually creates the database tables.
php artisan migrate

# With the tables in place, now you can define the domain/model classes
# Define the Domain classes in app/models/
